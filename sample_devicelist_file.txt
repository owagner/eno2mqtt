#
# The Device List file defines all devices with their Enocean ID, their type (Enocean Equipment Profile, EEP)
# and a symbolic name to be used in the MQTT hierarchy.
#
# The ID is in hex notation
# The EEP is specified in the format taken from Enocean's EEP PDF (https://www.enocean.com/en/knowledge-base/)
# The symbolic name is up to the user. Note that depending on the profile, the symbolic name may be suffixed to
#  form multiple different topics for different reading values 
#

# Example 1: A Hoppe window handle
1825116  F6-10-00	T端r K端che

# Example 2: An Elktao 4 rocker switch (FHS8) actually has two IDs
